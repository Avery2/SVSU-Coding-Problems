		String words = "to produce knowledge a claim must be made about something and for that claim to be valid it must be supported by evidence in this sense producing knowledge would be making a valid claim a claim that is adequately supported with evidence and accepting it to change it into knowledge in this definition of knowledge however lies at least two problems these are the variety of convictions and ways you can accept a claim and the problem of defining what is adequate evidence to support a claim and what is beyond the scope of the evidence so how does accepting conclusions that goes beyond out possessed knowledge allow the production of knowledge one question raised is how does the extent of evidence and the significance of conclusions form value in knowledge the relation between the significance of conclusions and extent of evidence is well highlighted in the fermi paradox the fermi paradox concerns the conflict between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life and estimates of its likeness while we have not yet encountered extraterrestrial life the vastness of the universe and therefore the number of earth like planets makes it seem likely to many that life would have formed on many other planets in the universe even if there was a miniscule chance of life happening on an earth-like planet the scale of the universe makes that miniscule chance significantly likely in addition to that looking at the history of mankind and how far we have advanced technologically despite being relatively young compared to the universe it would seem that extraterrestrial species that developed before us would advanced enough to have colonized the universe by now by using technology that would travel to a planet gather resources and then repeat the process it is estimated that it would only take 3 75 years to colonize our galaxy which is very little time in the scale of the universe all this culminates to a high likeliness that we would encounter extraterrestrial life but we haven’t the answers to fermi paradox are highly speculative yet concerns important concepts that draws great conclusions one such concept is called the great filter the great filter suggests that since we haven’t encountered life there must be something stopping it life from colonizing the universe some filter that stops all life before it can develop to that level of technology this has led many to make conclusions such as humans are unique since the great filter is something primordial such as life developing at all becoming multicellular or maybe even intelligence developing other conclusions are more bleak suggesting that intelligent species all meet their end before they can colonize the universe which suggests that us humans are moving towards that end as well in the end there seems to be a conflict around the validity of the knowledge created on one end the nature of the fermi paradox is extremely speculative and has little solid evidence supporting it but on the other hand the significance of the conclusions are vast such as the possibility that either humans are alone or that we are going to reach our end soon either way it seems that knowledge is created by going beyond the evidence because in this case there is little evidence but the significance of the conclusions makes up for it additionally the conviction in accepting this knowledge doesn’t have to be strong for any singular answer to the fermi paradox we do not have to treat one theory as truth rather we can treat them all as possibilities in this way useful knowledge has been created even though it goes beyond the evidence sometimes the conflict between the significance of conclusions and extent of evidence cannot be concluded as it was above when conviction is necessary how should belief be formed depending on the significance of conclusions and evidence blaise pascal found this conflict in his religion pascal’s wager was to believe in the catholic version of god even without the assurance of god’s existence due to the significance of the outcomes of god’s existence namely heaven and hell in pascal’s wager the argument that best embodies this interaction between the significance of conclusions is the dominating expectations argument here the significance of the conclusion is heaven and hell or infinite reward and infinite punishment if god exists and some finite rewards or punishments of believing in god even if god doesn’t exist pascal noted that no one had yet been able to prove god’s existence or nonexistence but concluded so the evidence might not be satisfactory to some but it didn’t matter due to the significance of the conclusions involved to combine this evidence and the outcomes pascal used something called decision theory in which you choose based on the best expectation where expectation is the value of the outcome times the probability of them happening in the dominating expectations argument there are four possible expectations belief in god and god’s existence belief and nonexistence nonbelief and existence and nonbelief and nonexistence the argument goes that the two expectations that come from god’s existence are infinitely positive and negative since the possibilities of either no matter how big or small are positive and the outcomes were infinite reward and punishment the expectations that arise from god’s non existence however are finite since they come from a finite possibility and a finite reward or punishment therefore pascal says you must go with the expectation that is infinitely positive which comes from believing god is real there are many issues that others have brought up about pascal’s wager for example that decision theory cannot decide which religion to believe in and that pascal gives no reason to apply this reasoning to only the catholic god something that shows the flaws in using pascal’s method of comparing conclusions and evidence is st petersburg paradox which takes issue with pascal’s use of infinite values in the st petersburg paradox a game is proposed where there is a infinite reward but a extremely low finite possibility of it the game is a coin toss where your reward grows exponentially with each head you land but on tails you lose the game and get no reward so the possibility of winning shrinks as well here decision theory says you should pay any amount that isn’t infinite to just play the game since the reward is infinite despite an extremely low chance of winning in the end it seems that the the significance of outcomes is related to the subjective values that each person applies to them but when infinite values try to avoid the subjectivity of this and prove something absolute it will run into problems it is one example of the difficulties with deciding something with absolute conviction and the tangled relationship between conclusions and evidence so far the knowledge that was demonstrated were theories or to be believed with little conviction but the last point is one that is epistemological and shows that much knowledge is beyond the evidence for it as the internet encyclopedia of philosophy puts it in what sense can knowledge exist independently of experience postulates can be a priori or a posteriori a priori is a postulate based on independent of experience while a posteriori is based on experience while it can get much more complex this distinction is importance if you consider like many do a posteriori inherently subjective and therefore any conclusions based on those premises beyond the evidence this search for a priori postulates or knowledge independent of experience is a long one many have searched for it one such person is rene descartes descartes had a famous thought among is work cogito ergo sum he thought that the act of thinking proved his existence i think therefore i am some people find issue in this lastly it is important to look at the real life applications of this in an article by aeon they provide evidence that psychology has cultivated about the darker meaning immoral nature of humans they look at things such as people’s base emotions about certain things such as people’s tendencies to rank outsiders as lower or less human than others or showing less brain activity on lower status people such as homeless compared to the rich even within the young in the end of the article the author gives a message of how in spite of this many people overcome these base feelings and act morally what is significant about this ending is that it concludes humans’ base nature is dark and immoral while not making conclusions about the entire nature of humans in general it does make a conclusion about our base nature even if not to any great conviction since it was implied in the end no conclusion could really be drawn from all the experiments those outcomes themselves were already conclusions from the data collected yet the significance of the human condition was a conclusion that went beyond the evidence showing a level of conviction this conclusion is one of truth describing the reality of human’s base nature but the others can be of possibility like in the fermi paradox or in hypotheticals such as in pascal’s wager so accepting conclusions beyond the evidence for them can create knowledge as long as the conviction of the acceptance is not absolute ";
